# RNA-Splicing

This project aims to scan genome sequence to identiofy mutations that seem to be responsible for splicing dyregulation in cancer.
**extract_all_events.py** and **process_all_sequences.py** are scripts to pre-process the splicing events and the genome sequences respectively.
**conv1d_pkoo_TCGA_splicing_prediction.py** runs the convolutional neural network model.
The pytohn notebooks show an analysis of the correlation of the RNA binding protein peak enrichement with two benchmarking methods.
